Alice\u2019s Evidence\n\nCHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice\n\u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs.

Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by\nrailway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.\u201d\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\n\u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she\nbegan: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2014of\na mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\u201d) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cO\u00f9 est ma chatte?\u201d which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like\ncats.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould\n_you_ like cats if you were me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry\nabout it.

Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am\nolder than you, and must know better;\u201d and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I\u2019ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle.

Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\nanything else.\n\nCHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n\u201cWho are _you?_\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.

However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\n\u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.\n\n---\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n---\n\n\u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\n\u201cWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnd where _have_ my\nshoulders got to?

The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u201d\nthought Alice, \u201cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be\nmurder to leave it behind?\u201d She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n\u201cDon\u2019t grunt,\u201d said Alice; \u201cthat\u2019s not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.\u201d\n\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. \u201cBut perhaps it was only\nsobbing,\u201d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.\n\nNo, there were no tears. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u201d\nsaid Alice, seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you.

This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.\n\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \u201cIf it had grown up,\u201d she said to\nherself, \u201cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\u201d And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, \u201cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201d when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.\n\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.

Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can draw water out of a water-well,\u201d said the Hatter; \u201cso I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well\u2014eh, stupid?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they were _in_ the well,\u201d Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.\n\n\u201cOf course they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201c\u2014well in.\u201d\n\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\n\u201cThey were learning to draw,\u201d the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \u201cand they drew all manner of\nthings\u2014everything that begins with an M\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy with an M?\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the March Hare.\n\nAlice was silent.\n\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: \u201c\u2014that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say\nthings are \u201cmuch of a muchness\u201d\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, now you ask me,\u201d said Alice, very much confused, \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d said the Hatter.\n\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.", "start_char_idx": 80534, "end_char_idx": 84290, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69e2e0e6-1cfc-4fad-b098-685b50a9cb40": {"__data__": {"id_": "69e2e0e6-1cfc-4fad-b098-685b50a9cb40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdef4afe-788e-4a46-bfe6-5712496fe56c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "4ba0aa0080d2cc150a5e3208817ef9cdb3a29588db817ea37c7bd7c018f8390f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab23e5c5-7f67-497b-ac05-deca84d23daf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "7337b3726005d5ec0b47216a871f632dfe22f2903bd32c0cb573dcc1742dfb04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05ff6fb9-5e25-4c15-b194-09affc34c443", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2426c5197135dbdbc04123c9f96da8f9b3cd6feea5a5bd220fea96f47804e9ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cAt any rate I\u2019ll never go _there_ again!\u201d said Alice as she picked her\nway through the wood. \u201cIt\u2019s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\nall my life!\u201d\n\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. \u201cThat\u2019s very curious!\u201d she thought. \u201cBut\neverything\u2019s curious today.

There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.", "start_char_idx": 84292, "end_char_idx": 87817, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05ff6fb9-5e25-4c15-b194-09affc34c443": {"__data__": {"id_": "05ff6fb9-5e25-4c15-b194-09affc34c443", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdef4afe-788e-4a46-bfe6-5712496fe56c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "4ba0aa0080d2cc150a5e3208817ef9cdb3a29588db817ea37c7bd7c018f8390f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69e2e0e6-1cfc-4fad-b098-685b50a9cb40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "475864a0351e22470513ac02d2f2b05f7464394ebc1344687e3d56c5772ad3dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a060130-2831-4609-a1c4-d1b7c6ee764e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca23299e69f269dda38d698b33d6e247df4deb85755f6102b937aa7222719434", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; \u201cand besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,\u201d thought she, \u201cif people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\n\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely \u201cWho is this?\u201d She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\n\u201cIdiot!\u201d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201d said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, \u201cWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after\nall.

The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u201d Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, \u201cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear\noneself speak\u2014and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you\u2019ve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the\narch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you like the Queen?\u201d said the Cat in a low voice.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Alice: \u201cshe\u2019s so extremely\u2014\u201d Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n\u201c\u2014likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u201d\n\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n\n\u201cWho _are_ you talking to?\u201d said the King, going up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity.", "start_char_idx": 91559, "end_char_idx": 95401, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c261816-7ec0-44fe-8268-144022afcc10": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c261816-7ec0-44fe-8268-144022afcc10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdef4afe-788e-4a46-bfe6-5712496fe56c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "4ba0aa0080d2cc150a5e3208817ef9cdb3a29588db817ea37c7bd7c018f8390f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a060130-2831-4609-a1c4-d1b7c6ee764e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "6c348fa4cd8e1b47db4920d816db7d0c021d3ba98d3bc4c4449c76a8f584b5a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7200891b-41cd-4a83-b419-cfaf4537ebc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9ad5ea065078b6223a1bfebd4abcedd313a7197cdca9cbad52a27a6f3e7755c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\u201d said Alice: \u201callow me to\nintroduce it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u201d said the King: \u201chowever, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d the Cat remarked.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be impertinent,\u201d said the King, \u201cand don\u2019t look at me like\nthat!\u201d He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n\n\u201cA cat may look at a king,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve read that in some book,\nbut I don\u2019t remember where.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it must be removed,\u201d said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u201cMy dear!

She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t\nmatter much,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cas all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.\u201d So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.\n\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said.\n\nThe executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn\u2019t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n\nThe King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren\u2019t to talk nonsense.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in\nless than no time she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.)\n\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \u201cIt belongs to the\nDuchess: you\u2019d better ask _her_ about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in prison,\u201d the Queen said to the executioner: \u201cfetch her here.\u201d\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\n\nThe Cat\u2019s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\n\nCHAPTER IX.\nThe Mock Turtle\u2019s Story\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\u201d\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u2019s,\nand they walked off together.\n\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cWhen _I\u2019m_ a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), \u201cI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.", "start_char_idx": 95403, "end_char_idx": 99361, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7200891b-41cd-4a83-b419-cfaf4537ebc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7200891b-41cd-4a83-b419-cfaf4537ebc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdef4afe-788e-4a46-bfe6-5712496fe56c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "4ba0aa0080d2cc150a5e3208817ef9cdb3a29588db817ea37c7bd7c018f8390f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c261816-7ec0-44fe-8268-144022afcc10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "c68b4b0447db25afcfea96d08a615e6f8be1f5bb09ac7352579d0c294774f922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7c12a1a-8624-4e77-af09-2b8080ba3a91", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30828b7987f48f4545d5107ad344cbe7a0e5689d474d44b400ed81373cb48537", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Soup\ndoes very well without\u2014Maybe it\u2019s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,\u201d she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, \u201cand vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes\nthem bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered.

She\npitied him deeply. \u201cWhat is his sorrow?\u201d she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u201cIt\u2019s all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5.

Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.", "start_char_idx": 160149, "end_char_idx": 163327, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"cdef4afe-788e-4a46-bfe6-5712496fe56c": {"node_ids": ["b4da393a-4539-4944-b04b-d1e801c393cb", "a60a3db1-6dc1-4ad8-b086-39b61fb2a28d", "66f2d371-6f47-4dc6-830d-4c1dc8f74034", "a19dc106-aa35-4e25-94ca-7cc1e3501708", "d79bb089-f2b4-4219-991e-bb5af7914066", "2cfc153c-b0c7-4788-92d1-9c6a5ec096d0", "a6c11656-76f1-4dc0-8053-13a3ea85926c", "49a3cfa7-a9e5-4778-83b1-bbaa096697ef", "1d4ce6e0-a5ba-47b5-9f47-8d228c48b253", "28d8e01e-c177-4e4b-b10d-8828250a3efe", "1361bc5f-b45e-4dce-8824-a42619aeca4c", "8cabe409-97b3-4ffe-a72b-38cf196015e0", "025b7cb3-f2bc-47eb-b3fe-ae2431aa3d06", "1ff4053e-31ac-4bcf-8a3d-7c536c761668", "09d0afa3-0c7c-43d8-930f-436bebbf3c67", "744ff1d8-ce3e-40d8-bb90-ee3ff2301ac9", "a9ff2efa-95fe-4909-9e08-4dbe48b3b4cb", "54eefeb1-4246-440c-928b-f14b169c51c3", "05b5c04b-eef6-428e-b889-85e2ede3c132", "4c3ec45a-d5c0-4db0-86d2-e54cd6679dcc", "4c7dc0cf-e8a8-481a-9336-395fdd7e61d4", "2ca7c205-347e-4b56-8016-ff4c3f52d75e", "ab23e5c5-7f67-497b-ac05-deca84d23daf", "69e2e0e6-1cfc-4fad-b098-685b50a9cb40", "05ff6fb9-5e25-4c15-b194-09affc34c443", "8a060130-2831-4609-a1c4-d1b7c6ee764e", "1c261816-7ec0-44fe-8268-144022afcc10", "7200891b-41cd-4a83-b419-cfaf4537ebc4", "e7c12a1a-8624-4e77-af09-2b8080ba3a91", "a679e67f-bde1-4e3e-9be9-38056a6162b4", "7c89755e-7922-4d9f-94d3-fb2a2d0073e2", "99f43536-3633-4a09-982e-b6dbfa33e0fe", "933e1219-95aa-4a4a-8357-20a7d2a44e6d", "33051bbd-37ad-4ca0-b3f0-67b46a752248", "65aed19b-be6c-4b5d-8803-3008af3e6c83", "582f1b02-c4fa-44a7-b55f-4a72781e2dc1", "9002922a-9ec9-46d2-9b6e-44284d2dab6a", "8b96ecfa-363a-49db-8500-23e988b28461", "c6c21da9-b4c7-487e-ae34-7fd846fe091c", "180aceff-1bed-45af-a069-5cd9bb5cf1e8", "33891df6-bb0c-4e27-b1bb-063db2543944", "042e77dc-adfc-4941-89d9-c8f822aa75f0", "43563c11-2133-4392-9a5e-45787cb5a952", "e9ed65dd-3cc6-4518-b362-7a7f90b1523a"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170007, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}}}}
